# AI-Generated Visualizations — Figures 1, 3, and 6

This repository contains three figures generated using [Napkin.app](https://www.napkin.io/), created as part of a systematic review on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in *Hibiscus sabdariffa* research. These visuals summarize key concepts, the evolution of methodologies, and future research directions.

### Content

Artificial Intelligence is divided into two major components:

### 📘 I. Learning Methods (Machine Learning)
- 🔹 Supervised Learning: uses labeled data  
- 🔹 Unsupervised Learning: discovers patterns in unlabeled data  
- 🔹 Reinforcement Learning: trial-and-error with feedback

### 🧭 II. Application Areas
- 💬 Natural Language Processing (NLP):  
  translation, text generation, context extraction, question answering  
- 👁️ Computer Vision:  
  image recognition, machine vision  
- 🗣️ Speech Processing:  
  speech-to-text and text-to-speech  
- 🤖 Robotics:  
  autonomous and industrial robots  
- 🧠 Expert Systems:  
  rule-based decision making (no training needed)  
- 📍 Planning:  
  sequential decision algorithms

🛠️ *Note*: The Napkin-generated image was post-edited for icon consistency and semantic clarity.
