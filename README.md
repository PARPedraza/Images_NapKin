# AI-Generated Visualizations — Figures 1, 3, and 6

This repository contains three figures generated using [Napkin.app](https://www.napkin.io/), created as part of a systematic review on the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in *Hibiscus sabdariffa* research. These visuals summarize key concepts, the evolution of methodologies, and future research directions.
